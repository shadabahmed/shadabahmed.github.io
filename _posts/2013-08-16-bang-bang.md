The more you learn about the linux shell, the more you love it. Reason I am saying this because I recently saw this:

![sudo !!](http://i.stack.imgur.com/JTMlx.png)

This made me immediately google it and I found an excellent reference [here](http://craig-russell.co.uk/2011/09/28/bang-bang-command-recall-in-linux.html#.Ug0fy2QS2a4). 
This is a quick summary of the source:

    $ !!                     # Repeat last command
    $ !x                     # Repeat last command that started with x
    $ !?x                    # Repeat last command that has the substring x
    $ !10                    # Repeat 10th command in the history file
    $ !-10                   # Repeat 10th from last command in the history file
    $ !!*                    # Fetch parameters from last command
    $ !!^                    # Fetch first parameter from last command
    $ !!$                    # Fetch last parameter from last command
    $ !!3                    # Fetch third parameter from last command
    $ !!:s/foo/bar/          # Repeat last command substituting foo for bar
    
If you append ```:p``` to any of the above commands then it will only print the command than running it

## Infinite Bang Bang

Now what if the last command also contains a ```!!```. Would it become recursive ? Let's see:

    # : is noop operator. This command sets up our base. 
    # Note that the !! inside single quote doesn't expand to the previous command
    $ : '!!'
  
    # Let's start our recursive operation in here. This is the first sequence in the chain
    # Only the !! inside double quotes expands to the previous command - : '!!'
    $ : "!!" '!!'

    : ": '!!'" '!!'

    # Pressing up arrow, we have a second sequence
    # Once again, only !! inside double quotes expands and !! appears 3 times after expansion
    $ : ": '!!'" '!!'

    : ": ': ": '!!'" '!!''" '!!'

    # Now, third sequence - !! appears 5 times
    $ : ": ': ": '!!'" '!!''" '!!'

    : ": ': ": '!!'" ': ": ': ": '!!'" '!!''" '!!'''" '!!'

    # Fourth Sequence - !! appears 17 times
    $ : ": ': ": '!!'" ': ": ': ": '!!'" '!!''" '!!'''" '!!'

    : ": ': ": '!!'" ': ": ': ": ': ": ': ": '!!'" ': ": ': ": '!!'" '!!''" '!!'''" '!!''" ': ": ': ": '!!'" ': ": ': ": '!!'" '!!''" '!!'''" '!!'''" ': ": ': ": '!!'" ': ": ': ": '!!'" '!!''" '!!'''" '!!''''" '!!'

    # Fifth
    $ : ": ': ": '!!'" ': ": ': ": ': ": ': ": '!!'" ': ": ': ": '!!'" '!!''" '!!'''" '!!''" ': ": ': ": '!!'" ': ": ': ": '!!'" '!!''" '!!'''" '!!'''" ': ": ': ": '!!'" ': ": ': ": '!!'" '!!''" '!!'''" '!!''''" '!!'

    : ": ': ": '!!'" ': ": ': ": ': ": ': ": '!!'" ': ": ': ": ': ": ': ": '!!'" ': ": ': ": ': ": '
    ... # !! appears 161 times

In the sixth sequence ```!!``` appears **15681** times and in the seventh, more than **150 million** times. Do not even try to run it for the 7th iteration unless you want to end up with a 2GB history file and your shell stuck for hours at 100% CPU.

The 8th sequence has more than **16 Quadrillion** bang bangs

Now, I haven't been able to figure out the exact equation yet for the number of ```!!``` in nth sequence,  but this is what happens:

* Any ```!!``` not surrounded by any quotes is expanded to the previous command
* ```!!``` surrounded only by single quotes ```'!!'``` do not expand
* ```!!``` surrounded by double quotes at the outermost level are expanded, even if that bang bang  is nested inside single quotes. For e.g. ```" '!!' "```

The approximate equation is like this:

    f(n) ~ f(n-1)*f(n-1)/2 + f(n-1)/2

Let me know if you can figure out the exact equation. The above commands have been tested on sh and bash.

Update: Thanks to [Volker](https://github.com/vog), we have code to calculate the exact number of bang bangs in nth sequence, [here](https://github.com/vog/bangbang), which works till the 7th sequence. 

Volker has even submitted the **Bang Bang Numbers** at [OEIS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences) and the sequence has been accepted. View it over [here](https://oeis.org/A228162)

Update2: [Robin Houston](https://github.com/robinhouston) wrote an analysis of these numbers on his [blog](http://bosker.wordpress.com/2013/08/16/using-group-theory-to-understand-unix-command-substitution/). He also wrote this code for generating the numbers in the **Bang Bang Numbers** series:

    # /usr/bin/env python
    p, q = 2, 4
    for i in range(4, 16):
      print "%d: %d" % (i, 4*p + 2*q + 1)
      p,q = 3*p*p + 2*p + p*q, 2*q + 2*p*p + 2*p*q
